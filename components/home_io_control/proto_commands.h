/// @file proto_commands.h
/// @brief Command builders for the IO‑Homecontrol protocol.
/// @ingroup hioc_protocol
///
/// This module provides builder functions that populate IoFrame structures for
/// the various commands used in discovery, pairing, control, and status operations.
/// All builders follow the same pattern: fill an IoFrame with CTRL0/CTRL1 flags,
/// addresses, command ID, and optional payload.
///
/// Position encoding:
///   - IO protocol position values: 0 = fully open, 100 = fully closed, for a non-inverted
///     device — but this is per-device, not a universal wire constant: IoDevice::inverted
///     devices (e.g. horizontal awnings) have it backwards (0 = fully closed, 100 = fully
///     open). Never hardcode "0 = open" in caller code without checking inversion first.
///   - Use create_execute_position() for numeric positions (0–100).
///   - Use create_execute_command() for named commands: CoverCommand::STOP,
///     CoverCommand::FAVORITE, CoverCommand::VENT.
///   - Use create_force_open() for CoverCommand::FORCE_OPEN — it takes the target "fully open"
///     position explicitly rather than assuming 0
///   - The Home Assistant layer maps HA's 1.0=open/0.0=closed to the IO scale via
///     ha_position = 1.0 - (io_position / 100.0), or the inverted form for IoDevice::inverted
///     devices; see platform_cover.h.
///
/// Low‑power flag and preamble handling:
///   - CTRL1_LOW_POWER is a per‑device property on the command path. Every device‑addressed
///     builder on that path takes an explicit `low_power` argument, set from the target's
///     YAML‑declared `low_power` class (default false: an always‑listening receiver).
///     Battery/solar devices that duty‑cycle their receiver get the flag; mains devices do not,
///     matching a reference hub's own traffic. The pairing and device‑role builders
///     (`create_key_init`, `create_key_transfer`, `create_set_config1`,
///     `create_status_update_resp`) keep a fixed value instead — see ADR 0029's out‑of‑scope note.
///   - The preamble follows the flag. For a start frame the exchange engine uses LONG_PREAMBLE
///     (1024 bytes) when CTRL1_LOW_POWER is set — the wake‑up burst for a sleeping receiver —
///     and the runtime‑tunable `normal_start_preamble` otherwise; follow‑up frames use the
///     driver's response_preamble() (exchange_engine.cpp). The flag and the preamble can never
///     disagree because both derive from the same per‑device property.

// ============================================================================

// 1W has no reply and no challenge: a controller transmits once and the frame either lands or it
// doesn't — there is no ACK to retry on and no 0x3C/0x3D to authenticate through, so the MAC
// inside the payload (create_1w_hmac(), sequence-keyed rather than challenge-keyed) is the only
// authentication a receiving device gets. The destination is a device *class*
// (encode_broadcast_address(), proto_codecs.h), never an individual node — 1W has no addressed
// unicast form at all. Both builders below are pure: they take `sequence` and `controller_key` as
// parameters and neither increment, persist, nor look either up. The sequence store and the
// identity registry that own those concerns (OneWayControllerRegistry, oneway_controller.h)
// arrive in a later step; until then callers are responsible for supplying both.

// ============================================================================
//
// Enrollment is the precondition the two builders above assume away: a device obeys a 1W frame
// only from a *registered* controller, so a correctly-keyed, correctly-signed execute from an
// unknown source node is silently ignored (see ADR 0026). These two builders are how a
// controller identity registers itself (0x30) or un-registers (0x39). Like the execute builders,
// both are pure — `sequence` and `controller_key` are parameters, never looked up or persisted —
// and both broadcast to the typed "all" address the same way create_1w_execute_command() does:
// there is no addressed/unicast form, and for a virgin 1W-only device there is usually no address
// to unicast to anyway.

/// @brief Build a 1W add-controller frame (CMD 0x30) that registers this identity as a controller
/// on every device of `target_type` currently in association mode — a physical 2 s PROG hold on
/// the receiver, which only the device's owner can trigger (see ADR 0026).
///
/// The payload wraps `controller_key` for transmission rather than sending it in the clear:
/// `enc_key = crypto::crypt_1w_key(src, controller_key)`, the same self-inverse primitive
/// decode_1w_add_controller() uses to unwrap an overheard 0x30 (crypt_1w_key() is its own
/// inverse, so this call and that one are literally the same function). The wrap key is the
/// public TRANSFER_KEY
/// (proto_constants.h) and the wrap IV derives only from `src` — see crypt_1w_key()'s doxygen for
/// why that is not a weakness: the receiver decrypts `enc_key` first, then checks this frame's MAC
/// under the key it just recovered, which is what makes the MAC meaningful (it proves the sender
/// holds the key it just sent), not the wrap's secrecy.
///
/// Declared payload (20 bytes): `enc_key[16] + manufacturer[1] + data[1]=0x01 + sequence[2]`.
/// **When `with_mac` is true, the MAC is an out-of-length trailer, not part of the declared
/// payload** — CTRL0's 5-bit length field cannot express 29 declared bytes plus a 6-byte MAC
/// together (see `IoFrame::has_mac`, `frame_carries_mac_trailer()` in proto_frame.h), so this
/// builder sets `f.has_mac = true` and fills `f.mac[]` directly; `serialize()` appends it after
/// the declared length and folds it into the length it returns, so a caller's CRC (computed over
/// that return value) covers it automatically. **When present, this is the opposite placement
/// from create_1w_remove_controller() below, whose MAC sits inside the declared payload** —
/// copying one builder's shape to make the other is the most likely bug a future edit introduces
/// here.
///
/// @warning **Real hardware and the published documentation vector disagree on whether the MAC
/// trailer exists at all — this is why `with_mac` is a parameter, not a fixed choice.** The
/// published `linklayer.md` vector (`with_mac=true`, 35 bytes) is what `with_mac` defaults to,
/// for compatibility with that vector's own pinning tests. Most real hardware captures instead
/// show 29 bytes with **no trailer at all** — see
/// `tests/corpus/captures/enrollment/somfy_smoove_enrollment_add_and_remove_controller_sx1276.yaml` — matching
/// the reference `_p0x30` struct (`iohcPacket.h`, no `hmac` field). **The enroll button calls
/// this with `with_mac=false`** to match that shape, but this is a preference rather than a
/// hardware requirement: a real Somfy Izymo dimmer has separately been shown to accept the
/// `with_mac=true` form as well, enrolling successfully and remaining controllable afterward —
/// both shapes are safe to send.
///
/// @warning Reference divergences, deliberately not followed:
